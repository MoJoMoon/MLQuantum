Machine Learning with Quantum Computing
The multivariate linear regression is one of the most used techniques to make predictions on the basis of a set of training data. It responds to questions like: at what price I can expect to sell a house of 100 square meters with 4 rooms?
What is the expected market growth depending on the increase of salaries and other KPIs?
What I tried to do was to provide a so called Normal Form solution by using Quantum Computing algorithms with the purpose of making QC more familiar
